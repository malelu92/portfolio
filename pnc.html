          <p>
            This project proposed by PNC Bank, aimed to make teenagers more financially educated and get new clients to the bank. 
            Studies have found that financial literacy is low among teenagers and that this could have important implications for financial behavior.
            Moreover, 55% of young adults are not saving in either an individual Retirement account or a 401 account.
            Teenagers spend an estimated $155 billion per year, mostly for recreation and luxury items. 79 % of students aged
            16-22 have admitted they have never taken a class on finance. Our team produced a tool that could provide a better
            communication between teenagers and their parents, while teaching them financial education.

          <!-- FINAL PRODUCT -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Money Muscle</p>
          <p class="beginning">Focusing on the issue of making teens financially literate, our final solution is an app called MoneyMuscle. The app is provided by the user's bank and is intended to be jointly used by teens and parents through a joint account. Through this app teens and parents answer financial questions or budget wisely and earn stars that translate into an opportunity to earn a discount at participating restaurants. Discounts at restaurants positively reinforce learning and provides a delightful experience for both teens and parents as they have the chance to save money while fostering communication about financial topics in a fun way. Our end goal is to ingrain smart money habits in teens for a financially responsible future.</p>
          <p>For our final design we also analyzed what value MoneyMuscle would bring to a bank, which would incentivize them to participate in a program like this. By tying learning and rewards together the bank is associated with an enjoyable moment when users earn discounts at restaurants. The bank also is able to teach clients about financial concepts that align with their business goals. In addition the bank generates cross selling, which allows the bank to profit from their users. Also, the marketing exposure can increase the number of customers in the bank that is educating teenagers financial concepts in a trustworthy and effective way.</p>

          <!-- RESEARCH -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Research</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Competitive analysis</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team started the project by researching what other banks were doing to teach teenagers financial education. 
          This search was conducted online and
          some of the main insights were that most banks provided solely online information for teenagers to learn financial literacy. The text was usually
          divided by topics and people had to filter them. Some other banks provided different solutions, such as online games to teach users the value of
          money through simulations, group activities and videos. One of the banks even provided a "moving out camp", giving teens intensive training on basic 
          financial aspects necessary when leaving home.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Stakeholder models</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">After doing the research, we created a stakeholder model, showing all entities that could educate teens on financial matters. The model created
          helped us better visualize the available stakeholders.</p>
          <div class="col-12">

            <br><br>
          </div>
          <p>We also identified that the specific group of earning teenagers was not specifically targeted by banks. We understand the group of earning 
          teenagers to be composed of teenagers that make money working or from gifts. In order to better visualize it, we created a model showing
          which specific targets each bank has.</p>

          <!-- IDEATION -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Ideation</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Current State Model</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Based on the research findings, the team created a current state model, having our target group, earning teens, in the center and 
          mapping which entities influence the group's spending habits. The influences are marked in the arrows, correlating each entity.
          The most interesting insight from this model is that we couldn't find a direct link between the teenagers and the bank, because most
          teenagers don't have bank accounts. The team decided then, that one of our main goals in this project would be to create this lacking connection.

          to better analyze our users' and stakeholders' main needs and goals.</p>

          <p>Felix is a smart 16-year-old high school student, who is currently taking multiple AP classes. He works really hard in school to go to NYU and wished that he could help his parents pay for his tuition. His parents give him weekly allowance during the school year, but otherwise, he works for money during the summer. His financial short-term goals discourage him to keep his discipline in saving up money for college. He wished that he could find a way to save money and fulfill his current needs at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>Marcia is a 55-year-old mom who has 3 children, aged 16, 14 and 12. Her and her husband try to keep their financial matters private from her children, in order to not overwhelm them. At the same time, she would like them to be more interested and knowledgeable in financial topics. Her eldest son, in particular, doesn’t have the best spending habits and never listens to her advice. She gives her kids weekly allowance but is not sure if this is the best practice for making them more money conscious, since they seem to take the money for granted.
          </p>
          <p>Sara works as a financial advisor in the student banking division of a bank. She noticed that many of the bank`s competitors provide similar student banking services so, Sara wants to create a unique strategy to differentiate her bank from others. She wants to create a product that focus on helping teenagers saves money, while fulfilling their short-term goals. She also wants teens to focus on their future, building good financial habits and prove to others that they are responsible young adults.

          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Design Sprint</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">To move our team along, we decided to do a one day Design Sprint to quickly brainstorm solutions and design a storyboard 
          that reflect our top 3 solutions. We began with restating our long term goal to refresh our memory and keep the Design Sprint focused. 
          Then, we continued by identifying pain points on the current state Value Flow Diagram. Using these pain points, we were able to create How Might We… 
          statements that articulate problem space which we use to drive our service design development. We continued by affinity grouping How Might We… statements 
          and then voted problem spaces that are in line with the research we have done earlier on. 
          </p>
          <p>Focusing on the chosen problem space, we brainstormed concepts by using the Crazy 8 seconds method which helped us generate over 30 concepts 
          in under 30 minutes. 
          Again, we affinity grouped our concepts and critique them by identifying each one Pro, Con and Opportunity space that may come up if we decide to develop 
          the idea further. Lastly, we discuss and voted on the top three concepts that has a large space in being developed. This Design Sprint process helped 
          us to create, design and decide our top three scenarios which are Game-Based Solution, Goal-Based Solution and Collaboration-Based Solution.

          <p class="beginning"><b>Storyboards</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The next step was generating ideas and choosing the most popular among us to generate storyboards. We generated 9 different storyboards,
          which were game based, goal based, collaboration based and competitive based solutions.</p>

          <!-- ITERATION -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Iteration</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Speed Dating</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team conducted speed dating sessions with 6 teenagers and 2 parents, showing them the 9 previously developed storyboards. The main information obtained from them were that neither teenagers nor parents would like to have competition solutions and also didn't seem excited to learn from games or from long videos. On the other hand, most of them seemed excited to have an easy way of controlling or checking their spendings.</p>
          <p>Teenagers specifically seemed unable to translate game-based concepts into life habits. They also normally set goals only in terms of grades and competitions and felt uncomfortable during concepts that revolved around collaboration. Their explanation for that is that they would a collaboration with their parents would probably compromise their spendings privacy. Most explained that their main spendings revolve around food.</p>
          <p>Parents are wary about giving credit cards to teens and are worried that teens will have a "money-centered" approach in life, focusing their goals and habits mostly in saving money. They like the idea of incentivizing teens to get responsibilities done.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Adapting concept</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We used the speed dating findings to adapt our most promising idea, by adding rewards and stimulating collaboration between parents and teens, keeping their spendings private but targeting a dialog between both. For our final iteration, we decided to expand on our MoneyMuscle idea, which consisted of setting weekly goals, and pair it with a rewards / incentive based program that allows teens and parents to join together to earn discounts at their favorite restaurants. We chose restaurants because from our research we found that of all the areas where teens spend money, food was by far the most popular area. By answering financial questions or sticking to budgets on their joint account bank apps, teens and parents start to have an open dialogue about finance and with every correct answer they earn a star, then with four stars, teens and parents can cash in those stars for discounts at participating restaurants.</p>
