          <p>
            Our goal was to provide Markel Baking Systems, a product-based company that sells baking machinery and systems, a service-based mobile-app that utilizes emerging technology. Markel's clients are composed by huge baking good companies, who can lose millions of dollars in case a single machine in the production system stops working. It's key then, that Markel offers a sevice that can predict machine failure, saving technician's long working hours and keeping customer satisfaction.

          <p class="proj-text items">BakeWiz</p>
          <p class="beginning">After researching Markel's sale-cycle and customer base, as well as the value proposition of a mobile-app for Markel, we created BakeWiz, an app that utilizes predictive analytics to communicate machinery and system failure information to Markel's customers in an way that non-technicians and machine experts can understand. By collecting real machinery data from the clients during it's implementation, BakeWiz can use this analytics to point to technicians the most probable points of failure in the system when performance decreases. That way, a machine can be fixed before completely stopping and causing a block in production.</p>

          <p class="beginning">To validate our assumption about the purchasing process, we reached out to both the engineering team and sales team of Reading Bakery Systems, a branch of Markel Food Groups. <!--In their response, they confirmed that the equipment purchase process usually involves a sales engineer visiting factory space to consult and recommend possible equipment options. However,-->Neither of them mentioned they observe any major breakdown of this system, and neither of them confirmed there would be great value added from our proposed mobile service. For this reason, we then decided to change our solution to our second most promising idea, diagnostics.

Instead of a holistic view of the system, we present only the potential breakdowns, then the user will be directed to the physical location of the machine and fixing instructions in the next screen.</p>

          <p class="beginning">From our research, we learned that the production system Markel offers are large and complex. There are numerous break points that could impact production, yet there no good reporting system for technicians to locate these errors.

          <!--To further flesh out the mobile diagnostics service idea, we made concept sketches of service screens. The main function for our mobile diagnostics service would be to present our users with system status, and lead their attention to possible points of error. In this screen, we present the physical layout of the production line, current system performance, and possible break points along with their likelihood of error. We wanted our users to be able to quickly navigate through a complex physical space, thus we mark possible errors on the physical layout of the system.-->
          Due to the short time-schedule and the change of direction, our first wireframes were already high-fidelity.<!--Another crucial part of the service is to suggest fixes. In this concept screen, we assume the user has already pin-pointed to one machine, and we present more information about that machine. We list out the common problems this type of machine might encounter, and past incidents this machine had. From there, the user can read more about past incident reports to learn how the issue was resolved in the past.--></p>
