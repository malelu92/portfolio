          <p>
             Studies show that the great majority of teenagers in the USA are not financially literate and that 79 % of those aged 16-22 admitted they have never attended a class on finance. Reports on student debts, on the other hand, indicate that they have increased by 58% from 1997 to 2007. With that in mind, this PNC Bank sponsored project aims at <b>making teenagers more financially educated while simultaneously attracting new clients to the bank</b>. To that end our team produced a tool that stimulates financially oriented communication between teenagers and their parents, while teaching them basic finance principles.

          <p class="beginning">Directly geared into improving teenagers' financial education level, our final solution is an app called MoneyMuscle. It should be offered free of charge by the bank and is intended to be used by both teens and parents through a joint account. MoneyMuscle's basic idea is to stimulate teens and parents to answer financial questions or to set up budget goals for the week to earn stars that translate into an opportunity to earn a discount at participating restaurants.</p>
          <p>Money Muscle is able to engage teenagers in finance, an extremely important part of an adult's daily life but of little concern to a teenager. It also opens up a dialog channel between teens and parents on a subject that should concern both.</p>

          <p>Felix is 16 years old high school student who receives a weekly allowance from his parents during the school year and works during the summer break. His dream is going to college, but his financial short-term goals discourage him to keep his discipline in saving up money for that.
          </p>
          <p>Marcia is a 55 years old mom of 3 children. She would like her kids to be more interested and knowledgeable in financial matters. She gives her kids weekly allowance but is not sure if this is the best practice for making them more money conscious.
          </p>
          <p>Sara works as a financial advisor in the student banking division of a bank. She noticed that many of the bank`s competitors provide similar student banking services so she wants to create a unique strategy to differentiate her bank from others.

          <p class="beginning">We the decided to do a Design Sprint to quickly brainstorm solutions. 
          We firstly identified pain points on the current state Value Flow Diagram and based on them created How Might We... 
          statements that articulated the problem space we then used to drive our service design development. We continued by affinity grouping How Might We... statements 
          and then voted problem spaces that were in line with our earlier research.

          Again, we affinity grouped our concepts and identified each Pro, Con and Opportunity spaces likely to come up if we decide to develop 
          the idea further. Lastly, we chose the top three concepts which we considered had the largest space to develop: <b>Game-Based Solution, Goal-Based Solution and Collaboration-Based Solution</b>.

          <p class="beginning">Discounts at restaurants positively reinforce learning and provide a delightful experience for both teens and parents as they have the chance to save money while fostering communication about financial topics in a fun way.
          By tying learning and rewards together the bank is associated with an enjoyable moment when users earn discounts at restaurants. The bank is also able to teach clients financial concepts that are aligned with their business goals. In addition, it generates cross selling, which allows the bank to profit from their users. Finally, marketing exposure may increase number of customers, while teaching teenagers financial concepts in a trustworthy and effective way.</p>
