          <!-- RESEARCH -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Research</p>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Guerrilla Research</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team started with a broad scope problem of designing a peer economy app that would help victims of disasters. To better understand this scope we conducted guerrilla research trying to find out more information related to natural disasters in general and to understand how people who had been through them had to dealt with the situation.</p>
          <!--<p>Her university dorm had a fire and many students (who received financial aid from the government) lost most of their belongings. She said that the main problem was coordinating the number of items donated: they needed clothes, books, etc. In the end, they got a huge amount of clothes, way more than what they needed, but were still lacking other necessary items. She said it was hard not being able to communicate fast to donors that they didn’t need an specific item anymore. They were updating donation info on Facebook, but not everyone checked it. Another problem was the quality of the items donated. Some of them were in terrible conditions.</p>-->
          <!--<p>She was living in Japan during the earthquake in 2011. She needed to find shelter and did so by using Google maps. She had no Internet or phone signal and the only news she had were from the TV. She is Buddhist and was able to walk to a Buddhist center. People who helped with mattresses and food were the people responsible for the newspaper delivery, who had the neighborhood very well mapped. After this earthquake they created an app, which can let people know about an earthquake 5 seconds in advance. Many people uninstalled the app though, because after the earthquake they had weaker tremors on the following days and people would feel nervous about the alerts, expecting a stronger tremor. She said that the bad part was communication (to talk to family members. She didn’t know if her family was alright).</p>
          <p>Donated to people who were hit by flooding. Says that the biggest challenges were to know exactly what people needed and where to take the donated items to. Sometimes it might be also hard to take the items to the designated place herself. It really helps when volunteers can come over to get the items.</p>-->

          <p class="proj-text items">Ideation</p>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Scenarios</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">After finding out more about the needs and difficulties of people who pass through emergency situations and natural disasters<!--, along with people who are willing to donate and help,--> the team created 20 scenarios representing possible solutions. These scenarios represented solutions tackling the previously identified issues and suggested schedules pick-ups for shelter transportation and donations, debris clearing and real-time donation monitoring. <!--One example, that illustrated schedulling donations pick-ups was:</p>
          <p>Alex is organizing items to be donated to victims of an earthquake. She lives two hours away from the nearest collecting point and doesn’t have the time or means to the take the donations there. By using the emergency app she receives a notification that volunteers will be coming to her town to collect donations. Through the app, Alex can see exactly the day they are coming and has the option of adding her house to the desired route for collection. This way, Alex is able to help people in need even when she wouldn’t be able to personally take the items to the receiving centers. She is able to track the car and knows exactly when the volunteers will arrive.--></p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Personas</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">In order to better understand future customers, our team created two personas, each representing one side of the peer economy app, the victim and provider. <!--We created a customer persona, who is the one seeking help and a provider persona, who is the volunteer providing help.--> These personas helped us better visualize potential users and to develop final scenarios.</p>

          <p>Jeff, the volunteer, is 25 years old and lives in Immokalee, FL. He works in a local construction firm doing manual labor and drives a Ford F150 pickup truck. He has experienced three hurricanes during his time in Florida and has served as a volunteer after each one; he primarily transported people and heavy/large donations to the shelters and cleared large debris that blocked people from leaving their homes. Jeff helps people not only in his city, but also in the nearby ones. <!--He has particular attention to Naples, because many of his friends live there.--></p>
          <p>Linda is 36 years old and lives in Naples, FL. She is a single mother of an 7 year old boy and a 8 year old girl and works as an administrative assistant in the local elementary school. <!--It is enough for her family to get by but she is not well off.--> Her mother is 75 and lives nearby in an apartment by herself. Because her mother has trouble walking, Linda and her kids visit her in her apartment regularly. She has been through many hurricanes and has never evacuated, she has visited a center for donation one time and usually brings her mom to her house during hurricanes.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Final Scenarios</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">With the personas in mind, the team adapted three final scenarios. Two related to post-hurricane situations and one related to a pre-hurricane situation.</p>
          <p>The pre-hurricane one aimed to solve evacuation issues, facilitating the location of shelter and finding transportationt there in case needed. The post-hurricane ones tackled respectively in house donation pick-up in a scheduled time and debris clearing.</p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Storyboards</b></p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Speed Dating</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">With the storyboards in hand the group conducted speed dating sessions with different users, to find out their reactions about each idea. With this method, we were able to see if the product we created could potentially interest users. We learned for example that potential users really cared about their safety on using that app and requested a service that provided background checks on volunteers. <!--Some of their sayings were:</p>
          <p>"As long as there is verification that the drivers are good people (referenced Uber/Lyft background checks) it is a good idea. Safety is a priority in these situations. People lie that they are electricians or other services and steal from homes."--></p>

          <p class="beginning">When deciding the color scheme for our high-fidelity wireframes, we wanted to choose a shade of red, which, we believe, symbolizes emergency. In order to keep it a more friendly color, the team opted for a shade tending to pink. In order to have a clean and light background, we chose to have a white background, with other informations given mainly in black and gray.</p>
