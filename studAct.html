          <p>
            University students highly value student clubs. Be it sports, music, politics or others, clubs are
            an important part of most students' college experience. Making sure that the right clubs can be easily
            found by students is interesting for both them and the clubs themselves, which can benefit from a higher
            number of students associates. In this project, I developed an app that improves the search and communication with clubs at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy.

          <p class="proj-text items">ClubDiscover</p>
          <p class="beginning">ClubDiscover is an app that allows students to find the most suitable clubs based on their preferences and schedule and to easily obtain the desired information from club leaders. The app also keeps students updated all year long only with the events that fits their calendars and interests.</p>
          <!-- RESEARCH -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Research</p>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Interview</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">With the goal of improving on-campus student activitiy experience, the team interviewed student club leaders and
          regular students. Our goal was to determine students' level of interest on clubs along with their previous experience on finding them.
          Moreover we wanted to learn more about the recruitment process, the ease to find new members and communication with current club members.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Sequence Flow and Cultural Models</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Based on each interview, the team created sequence flows, to better understand the dinamics of club search, and cultural models simbolyzing the entities and relations involved. This helped us to better understand the problem context and to visualize it.</p>
          <br>

          </div>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Affinity Diagram</b></p>
          <p class="beginning"><!--During the process of creating the cultural models and the sequence flows, one of the team members was responsible for taking notes of the interview taken by other members and narrated by them. By doing that, the team was able to have a set of notes for each interviewee, containing one specific information.--> Using the notes from each interview we divided them by similarities, using an affinity diagram. We first grouped them using blue labels that represented the essence and concept of these grouped notes. The blue groups were them grouped under pink labels, simbolyzing common issues, which were them grouped again into potential goals, simbolized by green labels.</p>
          <br>
          <div class="col-12">
            <img src="images/stuAct/affinityDiagram.png" class="img-model diagrams" alt="affinity diagram">
            <br><br>
          </div>
          <p>After using the affinity diagram to understand the main issues for both students and clubs leaders, we consolidated the individual sequence flows and cultural models from each interviewee into a more general one. This permited again a more general understanding on the happening of events for club leader and students looking for clubs and how entities influence them and the process of joining clubs.</p>
          <!--<p>Our team had a very diversified set of interviewees. When we consolidated the sequence flow model, we tried to keep sequences on the flow that were similar to all of them. This consisted of two main events: (1) Events before the activities fair, when most students are looking for clubs, and club leaders are updating their club information, and (2) events during the activities fair. One problem we found with consolidating was the fact that the interviewees had diverse experiences: they consisted of both student leaders and students, and there were many things unique to single person/group. So, this made the final sequence flow and cultural diagram very general, and as such, the mention of individual clubs was generalized. Having a general model helps us making a solution that serves the need of a diverse group of people. Another problem we ran into was deciding on which information was general enough and should be kept. The badminton club, for example, had the unique sequence of becoming a CMU-recognized intramural club. This part of the flow was not consolidated, because we thought that this doesnâ€™t happen on a regular basis in most clubs.--></p>
          <!--<p>To consolidate such a diverse set of interviewees, we had to first identify the entities that were common to all four cultural models. This also involved combining some of the entities. For example, we combined "Facebook" from one model and "Strava" from another model to "social media" in the consolidated version. Another example was combining all the individual clubs (Scotch n Soda, Badminton Club, etc.) into the general entity "clubs". Sometimes interviewees had contradictory information; for example, the CMU Buggy Racing club is "exclusive" and "secretive", but the Film Club wants to be more "inclusive" and expand their membership. This consolidation does of course have tradeoffs: we lost some information that was specific to one or two subjects. At the same time, this means that our cultural model is generalized for the values of a whole variety of people. This will undoubtedly help us when we are creating a design solution, since we can make sure it serves the needs of a diverse group of people.</p>-->

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Design Ideas</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team "walked the wall" by observing individually the affinity diagram, consolidated sequence flow and consolidated cultural model and thought about design ideas and breakdowns in each model. We grouped the ideas and breakdowns by similarities and created visions of the most popular ones. The visions were analyzed by adding a "+" on parts that we considered good, based on obtained data, "-" on attributes that were not technologically viable
          and "?" for questions brought by the visions.</p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Storyboards</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We improved each vision by solving the negative points and the questions previously stated. The team then created storyboards for each of these visions to help us better visualize our proposed solutions and to more easily communicate them to potential users.</p>
          <!--<p>The storyboard shown below, for instance, represents the idea of an app that would get the schedule information provided by users and suggest clubs and events for them to attend.</p>-->

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Speed Dating</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We conducted speed dating sessions with each storyboard. These speed dating sessions consisted of having the users read aloud the storyboards and to analyze their needs and reactions to the proposed solution. The information collected from users' reactions and comments helped us to polish the ideas.</p>
          <p>Students' comments varied from finding the proposed solutions useful and others not that much. Students seemed excited about the idea of easily finding clubs that matched their schedules and interests and being able to keep tracking new events.<!--While one user said he could picture himself using the app during all his college years, other student was not so excited about it. She said that besides not keeping all her events on her calendar and, this way, being possibly notified by events she wouldn't be able to attend, she wants a break on her free time. This person also said she likes to plan things in advance, so she wouldn't go to events announced on the last minute. On the other hand, another user said he really liked the possibility of receiving interesting events that matched his free time, even if he didn't have time to go, knowing all the possibilities available provided a good feeling on him. Some suggestions were to show the duration of the event and to inform students at least one day in advance about a specific event in case it lasts for more than one hour. One last suggestion was displaying events that friends are also attending. --></p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Paper prototype</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Based on the feedback obtained, I designed a low-fidelity prototype to our most popular idea. This helped me understand if users could easily interact with the app and find the information they were looking for. One issue to be improved was making the event functionality more prominent in the app, since this is the main tool the team planned to use to have users interacting with our app all year long.</p>
