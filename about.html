  		<p> My name is Marina Leao Lucena and I come from Brazil. I'm a very international person, having pursued my bachelors degree in Computer Science in the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro and doing a one year exchange program at New York University. After this I obtained a Masters in Internet Technology and Architecture from Technical University Berlin and Pierre and Marie Curie University. Right now I'm pursuing another Masters, this time in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University and will graduating in August 2018. My goal is to transition from Computer Science into UX Design.</p>
  		<p>I like to challenge myself, so whenever I can, I try to work on areas and jobs outside my field of work. In 2011 I worked for three at Disney Animal Kingdom in Orlando as a Disney Cast Member, at the Wildlife Express Train attraction. In 2014 I worked for ACT3, Adidas Brazilian partner as a group guide in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. My job consisted of guiding groups of around 40 international guests around the city and take them to matches.</p>
