            This project proposed by PNC Bank, aimed to make teenagers more financially educated while attracting new clients to the bank. With that in mind, our team produced a tool that could provide a better financial oriented communication between teenagers and their parents, while teaching them financial education.

          <p class="beginning">Focusing on the issue of making teens financially literate, our final solution is an app called MoneyMuscle. The app is provided by the user's bank and is intended to be used by both teens and parents through a joint account. Through this app teens and parents answer financial questions and budget wisely to earn stars that translate into an opportunity to earn a discount at participating restaurants.</p>

          <p class="beginning"><b>Competitive analysis</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team conducted online secondary research, by doing a competitive analysis and literature review. We were able to identify the main solutions proposed by other banks and after acquiring some knowledge on 
          the theme, interviewed teenagers to learn more about their money habits and overall financial knowledge.</p>

          <p class="beginning"><b>Stakeholder models</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">During research, we created a stakeholder model, showing all entities that could educate teens on financial matters. We also identified that the specific group of "earning teenagers" was not specifically targeted by PNC competitors. That group is composed by working teenagers or teens who receive money as gift.</p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Current State Model</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team then created a current state model mapping which entities influence earning teens spending habits. 
          The most interesting insight was that we couldn't find a direct link between teenagers and banks, because most
          teenagers don't have bank accounts. Based on that, one goal became to establish that connection.

          <p>Felix is 16 years old high school student who receives a weekly allowance from his parents during the school year and works during the summer break. His dream is going to college, but his financial short-term goals discourage him to keep his discipline in saving up money for that.
          </p>
          <p>Marcia is a 55 years old mom of 3 children. Marcia and her husband try to keep their financial matters private from their children, in order to not overwhelm them. At the same time, she would like them to be more interested and knowledgeable in financial matters. She gives her kids weekly allowance but is not sure if this is the best practice for making them more money conscious.
          </p>
          <p>Sara works as a financial advisor in the student banking division of a bank. She noticed that many of the bank`s competitors provide similar student banking services so Sara wants to create a unique strategy to differentiate her bank from others.

          <p class="beginning"><b>Design Sprint</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">To move our team along, we decided to do a Design Sprint to quickly brainstorm solutions. 
          We firstly identified pain points on the current state Value Flow Diagram and based on them created How Might We... 
          statements that articulated the problem space we then used to drive our service design development. We continued by affinity grouping How Might We... statements 
          and then voted problem spaces that were in line with our earlier research.

          </div>
          <p>Focusing on the chosen problem space, we brainstormed concepts by using the Crazy 8 seconds method which helped us generate over 30 concepts 
          in under 30 minutes. 
          Again, we affinity grouped our concepts and identified each Pro, Con and Opportunity spaces likely to come up if we decide to develop 
          the idea further. Lastly, we chose the top three concepts which we considered had the largest space to develop: Game-Based Solution, Goal-Based Solution and Collaboration-Based Solution.

          <p class="proj-text items">Iteration</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Speed Dating</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team conducted speed dating sessions with 6 teenagers and 2 parents, showing them the 9 previously developed storyboards. We wanted to see their emotional reactions to our ideas and also identify if users would feel a need for our solutions. The main information obtained was that neither teenagers nor parents would like to have competition solutions and also didn't seem excited about learning from games or long videos. On the other hand, most of them seemed excited to have an easy way of controlling or checking their spendings.</p>
          <br>

          <br><br><br><br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Low-Fidelity Prototype</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We used the speed dating findings to adapt our most promising idea, by adding rewards and stimulating collaboration between parents and teens, keeping their spendings private but targeting a dialog between both. For our final iteration, we decided to expand on our MoneyMuscle idea, which consisted of setting weekly goals, and pair it with a rewards / incentive based program that allows teens and parents to join together to earn discounts at their favorite restaurants. I individually created a paper-prototype to quickly test the users' interaction with our product.<!--We chose restaurants because from our research we found that of all the areas where teens spend money, food was by far the most popular area. By answering financial questions or sticking to budgets on their joint account bank apps, teens and parents start to have an open dialogue about finance and with every correct answer they earn a star, then with four stars, teens and parents can cash in those stars for discounts at participating restaurants.--></p>

          <p class="beginning">Discounts at restaurants positively reinforce learning and provide a delightful experience for both teens and parents as they have the chance to save money while fostering communication about financial topics in a fun way.
          By tying learning and rewards together the bank is associated with an enjoyable moment when users earn discounts at restaurants. The bank is also able to teach clients financial concepts that are aligned with their business goals. In addition, it generates cross selling, which allows the bank to profit from their users. Finally, marketing exposure may increase number of customers, while teaching teenagers financial concepts in a trustworthy and effective way.</p>
