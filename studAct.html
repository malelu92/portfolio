          <p>
            University students highly value student clubs. Be it sports, music, politics or others, clubs are
            an important part of most students' college experience. Making sure that the right clubs can be easily
            found by students is not only interesting for students but for clubs as well, which can benefit from a higher
            number of students associates. In this project, I developed an app that improves the search and communication with clubs at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy.

          <!-- FINAL PRODUCT -->
          <p class="proj-text items">ClubDiscover</p>
          <p class="beginning">ClubDiscover is an app that allows students to find the most suitable clubs based on their preferences and schedule and to easily obtain the information they need from club leaders. The app also keeps students updated all year long only with those events that fit their calendars and interests.</p>
          <!-- RESEARCH -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Research</p>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Interview</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">With the goal of improving on-campus student activitiy experience, the team interviewed student club leaders and
          regular students. Our goal was to determine students' level of interest on clubs along with their previous experience in finding them.
          Moreover, we wanted to learn more about the recruitment process, on the ease to find new members and on the communication with current club members.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Sequence Flow and Cultural Models</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Based on each interview, the team created sequence flows, to better understand the dynamics of club search, and cultural models simbolyzing the entities and relations involved. That helped us to better understand the problem context and to visualize it.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Affinity Diagram</b></p>
          <p class="beginning"><!--During the process of creating the cultural models and the sequence flows, one of the team members was responsible for taking notes of the interview taken by other members and narrated by them. By doing that, the team was able to have a set of notes for each interviewee, containing one specific information.--> Interview notes were divided by similarities, using an affinity diagram. They were firstly grouped under blue labels that represented their essence and concept. These groups were then combined under pink labels, simbolyzing common issues, which were them grouped again into potential goals, under green labels.</p>
          <br>

            <br><br>
          </div>
          <p>After using the affinity diagram to understand the main issues for both students and clubs leaders, we consolidated the individual sequence flows and cultural models from each interviewee into a more general flows and models. Doing that gave us a more general understanding of the dynamics involving club leaders and potential members and how entities would influence them and the process of joining clubs.</p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Design Ideas</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">The team "walked the wall" by observing individually the affinity diagram, the consolidated sequence flow and the consolidated cultural model, and thought about design ideas and breakdowns for each model. We then grouped ideas and breakdowns by similarities and created visions of the most popular ones. Based on the data obtained, visions were then analyzed by associating a "+" to parts we considered good, a "-" to attributes that were technologically unviable
          and a "?" to questions brought about by visions.</p>

          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Storyboards</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We improved each vision by sorting out negative points and addressing previously stated questions. The team then created storyboards for each of these visions, allowing a better grasp of our proposed solutions and an easier communication of them to potential users.</p>
          <!--<p>The storyboard shown below, for instance, represents the idea of an app that would get the schedule information provided by users and suggest clubs and events for them to attend.</p>-->

          </div>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Speed Dating</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We conducted speed dating sessions with each storyboard. They consisted of having the users read aloud the storyboards and to analyze their needs and reactions to the proposed solution. Information collected from users' reactions and comments helped us polish ideas.</p>
          <p>Students' comments varied from finding some of our proposed solutions useful and others not that much. They seemed excited about the idea of easily finding clubs that matched their schedules and interests and also being able to keep track of future events.<!--While one user said he could picture himself using the app during all his college years, other student was not so excited about it. She said that besides not keeping all her events on her calendar and, this way, being possibly notified by events she wouldn't be able to attend, she wants a break on her free time. This person also said she likes to plan things in advance, so she wouldn't go to events announced on the last minute. On the other hand, another user said he really liked the possibility of receiving interesting events that matched his free time, even if he didn't have time to go, knowing all the possibilities available provided a good feeling on him. Some suggestions were to show the duration of the event and to inform students at least one day in advance about a specific event in case it lasts for more than one hour. One last suggestion was displaying events that friends are also attending. --></p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning topic"><b>Paper prototype</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Based on the feedback obtained, I designed a low-fidelity prototype to our most popular idea. That helped me understand how easily users would interact with the app and find the information they were looking for. One issue to be improved was making the event functionality more prominent within the app, since this is the main tool enviseged to have users interacting with our app all year long.</p>
