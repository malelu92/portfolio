          <p>
            Hurricanes hit the US and many countries every year. Whether they cause big destruction or only minor damages
            they scare citizens and bring uncertainty. With this in mind, LifeBoat consists of an application that allows citizens of 
            towns that can be or have been hit by hurricanes, to locate and/or drive other citizens to shelters and to help other members 
            in the community with debris emergencies. We aim to stimulate communication and help between the people of these cities.

          <!-- RESEARCH -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Research</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Guerrilla Research</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Since our team had decided to focus on natural disasters, emergencies and donations, we conducted guerrilla research trying to find out more information related to these topics. Some of our findings were:</p>
          <p>Her university dorm had a fire and many students (who received financial aid from the government) lost most of their belongings. She said that the main problem was coordinating the number of items donated: they needed clothes, books, etc. In the end, they got a huge amount of clothes, way more than what they needed, but were still lacking other necessary items. She said it was hard not being able to communicate fast to donors that they didn’t need an specific item anymore. They were updating donation info on Facebook, but not everyone checked it. Another problem was the quality of the items donated. Some of them were in terrible conditions.</p>
          <p>She was living in Japan during the earthquake in 2011. She needed to find shelter and did so by using Google maps. She had no Internet or phone signal and the only news she had were from the TV. She is Buddhist and was able to walk to a Buddhist center. People who helped with mattresses and food were the people responsible for the newspaper delivery, who had the neighborhood very well mapped. After this earthquake they created an app, which can let people know about an earthquake 5 seconds in advance. Many people uninstalled the app though, because after the earthquake they had weaker tremors on the following days and people would feel nervous about the alerts, expecting a stronger tremor. She said that the bad part was communication (to talk to family members. She didn’t know if her family was alright).</p>
          <p>Donated to people who were hit by flooding. Says that the biggest challenges were to know exactly what people needed and where to take the donated items to. Sometimes it might be also hard to take the items to the designated place herself. It really helps when volunteers can come over to get the items.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="proj-text items">Ideation</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Scenarios</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">After finding out more about the needs and difficulties of people who pass by emergency situations and natural disasters, along with people who are willing to donate and help, the team created 20 scenarios symbolizing possible solutions. One example, that illustrated schedulling donations pick-ups was:</p>
          <p>Alex is organizing items to be donated to victims of an earthquake. She lives two hours away from the nearest collecting point and doesn’t have the time or means to the take the donations there. By using the emergency app she receives a notification that volunteers will be coming to her town to collect donations. Through the app, Alex can see exactly the day they are coming and has the option of adding her house to the desired route for collection. This way, Alex is able to help people in need even when she wouldn’t be able to personally take the items to the receiving centers. She is able to track the car and knows exactly when the volunteers will arrive.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Personas</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Based on the research findings, the team idealized two personas, a volunteer and a user needing help in other to better understand our problem.</p>

          <p class="beginning">After analyzing all the different scenario ideas and taking the personas into account, we narrowed down our ideas and created storyboards of the features we wanted to have in our app.</p>
