        <p class="about-text">
        I'm a UX Designer with a background in Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science. I work in collaboration with project managers, designers and engineers to create valuable and meaningful user experiences always having the user in the center of the process. <!--My work process involves doing user research, interaction design, building interactive prototypes and validating the design with users.-->
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
        My path to UX Design wasn't always clear to me. When I started my undergrad all I knew was that I wanted to work on a field that mixed design and logic, but I was unaware of the existence of HCI and UX. After graduating in Computer Science and still looking for what I wanted to to, I took a mandatory Masters class that focused on UX and at that moment I knew I had found what I wanted to do. I'm passionate about emphatizing with the user and designing the best experience possible for people, always based on research data and usability tests.
