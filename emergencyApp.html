            Hurricanes hit the US and many countries every year. Whether they cause big destruction or only minor damages
            they scare citizens and bring uncertainty. With this in mind, LifeBoat consists of an application that allows citizens of 
            towns that can be or have been hit by hurricanes, to locate and/or drive other citizens to shelters and to help other members 
            in the community with debris emergencies. We aim to stimulate communication and help between the people of these cities.

          <!-- RESEARCH -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Research</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Guerrilla Research</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">Since our team had decided to focus on natural disasters, emergencies and donations, we conducted guerrilla research trying to find out more information related to these topics. Some of our findings were:</p>
          <p>Her university dorm had a fire and many students (who received financial aid from the government) lost most of their belongings. She said that the main problem was coordinating the number of items donated: they needed clothes, books, etc. In the end, they got a huge amount of clothes, way more than what they needed, but were still lacking other necessary items. She said it was hard not being able to communicate fast to donors that they didn’t need an specific item anymore. They were updating donation info on Facebook, but not everyone checked it. Another problem was the quality of the items donated. Some of them were in terrible conditions.</p>
          <p>She was living in Japan during the earthquake in 2011. She needed to find shelter and did so by using Google maps. She had no Internet or phone signal and the only news she had were from the TV. She is Buddhist and was able to walk to a Buddhist center. People who helped with mattresses and food were the people responsible for the newspaper delivery, who had the neighborhood very well mapped. After this earthquake they created an app, which can let people know about an earthquake 5 seconds in advance. Many people uninstalled the app though, because after the earthquake they had weaker tremors on the following days and people would feel nervous about the alerts, expecting a stronger tremor. She said that the bad part was communication (to talk to family members. She didn’t know if her family was alright).</p>
          <p>Donated to people who were hit by flooding. Says that the biggest challenges were to know exactly what people needed and where to take the donated items to. Sometimes it might be also hard to take the items to the designated place herself. It really helps when volunteers can come over to get the items.</p>
          <br>
          <!-- IDEATION -->
          <p class="proj-text items">Ideation</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Scenarios</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">After finding out more about the needs and difficulties of people who pass by emergency situations and natural disasters, along with people who are willing to donate and help, the team created 20 scenarios symbolizing possible solutions. One example, that illustrated schedulling donations pick-ups was:</p>
          <p>Alex is organizing items to be donated to victims of an earthquake. She lives two hours away from the nearest collecting point and doesn’t have the time or means to the take the donations there. By using the emergency app she receives a notification that volunteers will be coming to her town to collect donations. Through the app, Alex can see exactly the day they are coming and has the option of adding her house to the desired route for collection. This way, Alex is able to help people in need even when she wouldn’t be able to personally take the items to the receiving centers. She is able to track the car and knows exactly when the volunteers will arrive.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Personas</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">In order to better understand future customers, our team created two personas, each representing one side of the peer economy app. We created a customer persona, who is the one seeking help and a provider persona, who is the volunteer providing help. These personas helped us develop final scenarios.</p>
          <div class="col-12">
            <div class="img-model pnc-persona">
              <img src="images/emergencyApp/persona_jeff.png" class="img-model pnc-persona" alt="felix the teenager persona">

              <p class="centered">Linda the customer</p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
          </div>
          <p>Jeff, the volunteer, is 25 years old and lives in Immokalee, FL. He works in a local construction firm doing manual labor and drives a Ford F150 pickup truck. He has experienced three hurricanes during his time in Florida and has served as a volunteer after each one; he primarily transported people and heavy/large donations to the shelters and cleared large debris that blocked people from leaving their homes. Jeff helps people not only in his city, but also in the nearby ones. He has particular attention to Naples, because many of his friends live there.</p>
          <p>Linda is 36 years old and lives in Naples, FL. She is a single mother of an 7 year old boy and a 8 year old girl and works as an administrative assistant in the local elementary school. It is enough for her family to get by but she is not well off. Her mother is 75 and lives nearby in an apartment by herself. Because her mother has trouble walking, Linda and her kids visit her in her apartment regularly. She has been through fifteen hurricanes and has never evacuated, she has visited a center for donation one time. Linda usually brings her mom to her house during hurricanes.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Final Scenarios</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">With the personas in mind, the team adapted three final scenarios. Two related to post-hurricane situations and one related to a pre-hurricane situation.</p>
          <p>Locating a Shelter (Pre-Hurricane): Due to financial concerns working as a single mother, Linda could not take the time off work to evacuate her family. Because she did not know how severe the hurricane would be, and therefore how damaging it would be to her home, she stayed in Naples and hoped for the best. Twelve hours before landfall she learned the storm had grown to a Category 4 and she should evacuate but the highways were too congested to safely try. She quickly located the closest shelter with bed availability on the app and moved her family to safety to wait for the storm to pass. </p>
          <p>Tracking routes for donations (Post-Hurricane): Jeff is a volunteer helping victims of Naples, Florida, which was hit by a hurricane. He has a pickup truck and, being already registered as a volunteer in the emergency app, can offer help to pick up donations. Many people in his town, Immokalee are willing to donate items, but don’t have the means to take it to Naples. By using the emergency app, the donors can mark their houses as “willing to donate” in the app, which is able to create the optimum route for Jeff to pick up the items in the city.</p>
          <p>Debris clearing request (Post-Hurricane): Linda needs to buy medicine for her mother, who is sick. The main street of her neighborhood, though, has been blocked by a fallen tree, preventing residents of reaching the city center. Linda decides to use the Emergency app, taking a picture of the fallen tree and adding a message and emergency level to the request. In a short time, volunteers confirm that they are going to the neighborhood to clear the road.</p>

          <p class="proj-text items">Iteration</p>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Storyboards</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">After analyzing all the different scenario ideas and taking the personas into account, we narrowed down our ideas and created storyboards of the features we wanted to have in our app.</p>
          <div class="col-12">
            <img src="images/emergencyApp/storyboard1.png" class="img-model emerg-storyb" alt="storyboard showing the shelter ride feature">
            <img src="images/emergencyApp/storyboard2.png" class="img-model emerg-storyb" alt="storyboard showing the debris feature">
          </div>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Speed Dating</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">With the storyboards in hand the group conducted speed dating sessions with different users, to find out their reactions about each idea. With this method, we were able to see if the product we created could potentially interest users. Some of their sayings were:</p>
          <p>"As long as there is verification that the drivers are good people (referenced Uber/Lyft background checks) it is a good idea. Safety is a priority in these situations. People lie that they are electricians or other services and steal from homes."</p>
          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Low-fidelity wireframe</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">We prototyped a paper version of our app, in order to rapidly test it users checking if the people could easily understand the app usability and navigate on it.</p>
          <div class="col-12">
            <div class="col-6">
              <img src="images/emergencyApp/low_fi_4.png" class="img-model emerg-storyb" alt="low-fidelity wireframe of debris emergency screen on the customer side">
            </div>
            <p>Users can select on the map the desired location and create a debris emergency event. It allows them to put a description of the problem, add a level of risk and add pictures, to better transmit to volunteers the degree of the problem.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <div class="col-6">
              <img src="images/emergencyApp/low_fi_5.png" class="img-model emerg-storyb" alt="low-fidelity wireframe of debris emergency screen on the volunteer side">
            </div>
            <p class="col-6">Volunteers can easily evaluate the level of emergency on the map by seeing the numbers on top of each issue. When selecting an event, the information with picture and description pops up. By selecting "help" the user who posted the emergency is notified that help is coming.</p>
          </div>
          <p>We also built low-fidelity wireframes for the desktop views. Two of which are shown here. We wanted to convey the same type of information present in the app, but taking advantage of the extra space.</p>
          <div class="col-12">

          <br>
          <p class="beginning"><b>Color Scheme</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">When deciding the color scheme for our high-fidelity wireframes, we wanted to choose a shade of red, which, we believe, symbolizes emergency. In order to keep it a more friendly color, the team opted for a shade tending to pink. In order to have a clean and light background, we chose to have a white background, with other informations given mainly in black and gray.</p>
