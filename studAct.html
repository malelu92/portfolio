          <p>
            University students highly value student clubs. Be it sports, music, politics or others, clubs are
            an important part of most students' college experience. Making sure that the right clubs can be easily
            found by students is interesting for both them and the clubs themselves, which can benefit from a higher
            level of students asoociates. In this project, I developed an app that improves the search for clubs,
            benefiting both the students and the clubs.

          <p>Interview</p>
          <p>With the goal of improving on-campus student activitiy experience, me and my team conducted interviews on both student club leaders and
          regular students. With this, we wanted to find out from regular students how much students were interested on clubs, the time they search for 
          clubs to join and how is or was their experience on joining activities. For club leaders we asked about the recruitment process of their clubs,
          the facility to find new members and communication with club members. Notes taken from the interviews were organized per each user, keeping one 
          focus point on each different note.</p>
          <p>Sequence Flow and Cultural Models</p>
          <p>Based on each interview, the team created sequence flows, to better understand the dinamics of students looking for clubs and advertising them. 
          We also made cultural models, simbolyzing the entities involved and their relations.</p>

          <p>Affinity Diagram</p>
          <p>Using the notes from each interview we divided them by similarities, using a affinity diagram.</p>
          <img src="images/stuAct/affinityDiagram.png" class="col-12" alt="current state model">
          <p>We then created consolidated sequence flows and cultural models based on the insights and findings
          of the sequence flow.</p>
          <p class="proj-text items">Ideation</p>
          <p>Design Ideas</p>
          <p>The team "walked the wall" by observing individually the affinity diagram, consolidated sequence flow and consolidated cultural model and thought about design ideas and breakdowns in each model. We grouped the ideas and breakdowns by similarities and created visions of the most popular possible solutions. The visions were evaluated by adding a "+" on parts that work, based on the previously
          obtained data, "-" on attributes that don't fit the data or are not technologically possible.
          and "?" for questions brought by the visions.</p>

          <p class="proj-text items">Iteration</p>
          <p>Storyboards</p>
          <p>After trying to answer the "?" points the team created storyboards of each vision.</p>
          <img src="images/stuAct/storyboard.png" class="col-12" alt="current state model">
          <p>Speed Dating</p>
          <p>We conducted speed dating sessions with each storyboard. The information collected from users reactions and comments helped us to polish the ideas.</p>
          <p>Final Solution</p>
          <p>Finally, the team created ClubDiscover an app that permits students to find the most suitable clubs based on their preferences and free time.</p>
