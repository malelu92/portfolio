With the floor plan and size information of potential machines, users could place them in the space with real-time rendering. User will get our suggestions for machine selection and layout from this app, if they have no other questions, they could contact people from Markel for further purchasing.</p>

          <p class="beginning">To validate our assumption about the purchasing process, we reached out to both the engineering team and sales team of Reading Bakery Systems, a branch of Markel Food Groups. In their response, they confirmed that the equipment purchase process usually involves a sales engineer visiting factory space to consult and recommend possible equipment options. However, neither of them mentioned they observe any major breakdown of this system, and neither of them confirmed there would be great value added from our proposed mobile service.

          <p class="beginning"><b>Mobile Diagnostic Service</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">To discover new opportunities, we referred back to the concept sketches we made in early ideation stage. From the four different ideas we explored, diagnostics was promising. Following this lead, we focused our research effort in the domain of diagnostics. From our research, we learned that the production system Markel offers are large and complex. There are numerous break points that could impact production, yet there no good reporting system for technicians to locate these errors. We landed on our new idea, using real-time and predictive analytics to provide diagnostics of production systems.

          To further flesh out the mobile diagnostics service idea, we made concept sketches of service screens. The main function for our mobile diagnostics service would be to present our users with system status, and lead their attention to possible points of error. In this screen, we present the physical layout of the production line, current system performance, and possible break points along with their likelihood of error. We wanted our users to be able to quickly navigate through a complex physical space, thus we mark possible errors on the physical layout of the system.

            <br><br>
          </div>

          Another crucial part of the service is to suggest fixes. In this concept screen, we assume the user has already pin-pointed to one machine, and we present more information about that machine. We list out the common problems this type of machine might encounter, and past incidents this machine had. From there, the user can read more about past incident reports to learn how the issue was resolved in the past.

          <p class="beginning"><b>Revamping the Workflow</b></p>
          <p class="beginning">In the next iteration of our diagnostic service, we considered what features would provide the most value for our users and Markel. For our users, they wanted to fix the issue as fast as possible. Our new workflow is based entirely on this idea - to lead the user to the malfunctioning machine as quickly as possible. Instead of a holistic view of the system, we present only the potential breakdowns, then the user will be directed to the physical location of the machine and fixing instructions in the next screen. We discussed computer vision would be a great tool to help users locate issues in a complex system, thus we introduce a new feature that uses CV to scan the space and give instructions.
